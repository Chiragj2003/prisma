# Prisma ORM with TypeScript



Prisma ORM with TypeScript is a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that allows developers to interact with relational databases using TypeScript (or JavaScript). Prisma simplifies database operations like querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records, providing a type-safe API that makes working with databases more efficient and less error-prone.

## Key Features of Prisma ORM with TypeScript

### 1. **Type-Safe Database Queries**
Prisma auto-generates types based on your database schema, ensuring that queries are type-safe. This means you get autocomplete, type checking, and error catching directly in your code editor, making it easier to work with the database and reducing errors in your code.

### 2. **Database Migrations**
Prisma provides an easy-to-use migration system, allowing developers to define changes to the database schema using a declarative syntax. You can then apply those changes to the database using simple commands, ensuring smooth transitions and consistency between the database and application code.

### 3. **Seamless Integration with TypeScript**
Prisma is designed to work perfectly with TypeScript. The generated Prisma Client gives you full TypeScript support, making your code more maintainable, type-safe, and reliable. You get all the benefits of TypeScript, such as type checking and autocompletion, when interacting with your database.

### 4. **Query Builder**
Prisma allows you to write database queries using a fluent, easy-to-read API instead of raw SQL queries. It supports complex queries like joins, filtering, sorting, and pagination, making it more intuitive and less error-prone than writing raw SQL.

### 5. **Works with Multiple Databases**
Prisma supports multiple database engines, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and more. This flexibility allows you to easily switch databases or work with different database systems without having to drastically change your code.

### 6. **Prisma Studio**
Prisma Studio is a graphical interface that lets you explore and manipulate your database easily, without writing SQL queries. You can inspect records, update data, and run simple queries directly from Prisma Studio, making it a convenient tool for working with your database.
